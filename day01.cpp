//basic structure of cpp
#include <iostream> //iostream stands for standard input-output stream. This header file contains definitions of objects like cin, cout, cerr, etc.
//using namespace std; either std::
int main() { //main() is the function entry point
   std::cout << "Hello Debashish Bordoloi!"; //  "" is called as string
   return 0; // termination of program
            }



//High Level and Low Level Language
// low level - h/w closed
// high level - logical
// c cpp is deals with the hardware with any computer system so low level lang.
